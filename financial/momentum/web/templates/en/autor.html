        This website is part of my Final Degree Project for the Dual Degree in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Granada.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The project consists of the development and training of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for predicting stock prices in financial markets.
        Based on these predictions, investment portfolios are constructed, with assets rotating monthly according to predicted profitability.
